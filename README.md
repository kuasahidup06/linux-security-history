# Linux Security & Network Evolution Portal

A professional, high-performance web portal dedicated to the history of Linux and its pivotal role in the modern cybersecurity ecosystem. Built with a focus on "Security-by-Design" and clean technical documentation.

## 🚀 Overview
This project showcases the evolution of Linux distributions and the legendary tools that defined network security, such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit. It is designed for IT professionals, security analysts, and system administrators.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features
- **Frontend:** Semantic HTML5 & Modern CSS3 (Responsive Design).
- **Performance:** Ultra-lightweight static architecture for sub-second loading times.
- **Security Focused:** - Implementation of secure coding practices to prevent XSS.
  - Optimized for HTTPS deployment via GitHub Pages.
- **Content:** Curated historical data on Linux kernels and security-centric distributions (Kali Linux, Parrot OS, etc.).

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Value
As an expert in Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity, this portal is built to demonstrate:
1. **Hardened Infrastructure:** Utilizing static site generation to minimize the attack surface.
2. **Technical Accuracy:** Precise timelines for industry-standard penetration testing tools.
3. **Information Integrity:** Data sourced from verified technical documentation.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
